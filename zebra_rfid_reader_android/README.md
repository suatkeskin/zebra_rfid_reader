# zebra\_rfid\_reader\_android

The Android implementation of [`zebra_rfid_reader`][1].

## Usage

This package is [endorsed][2], which means you can simply use `zebra_rfid_reader`
normally. This package will be automatically included in your app when you do,
so you do not need to add it to your `pubspec.yaml`.

However, if you `import` this package to use any of its APIs directly, you
should add it to your `pubspec.yaml` as usual.

## Using built-in commands

The following is an example of using the pigeon code gen command:

`dart run pigeon --input ./pigeons/messages.dart`

The following is an example of using the build_runner build command:

`dart run build_runner build`
